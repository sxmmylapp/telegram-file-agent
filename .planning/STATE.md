## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- iCloud Drive has no server-side API -- v1 uses Telegram-uploaded documents only (iCloud deferred to v2)
- Claude API natively handles PDFs (32MB, 100 pages) and images -- no separate OCR or PDF parsing needed for summarization
- grammY chosen as Telegram framework (TypeScript-first, modern middleware API)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Claude API cost management needed -- large documents (100 pages) can cost $1-3 per request
- Telegram 20MB download limit may block some large scanned contracts
